# Packet Sniffer
Packet Sniffer created using scapy and Pysimplegui

# Usage
To get the program running first you need to have the required files and packages.
```
git clone https://github.com/nirmoru/packet_sniffer.git
cd packet_sniffer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then run the file ``main_gui.py`` using python with elevated privileges as packet capturing using scapy requires elevated privileges.
```
sudo python3 main_gui.py
```
